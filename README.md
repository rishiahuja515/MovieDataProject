## General info
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of pandas in analyzing large data sets. 
	
## Methods
After using pandas to rearch through each individual file, I decided on using the Numbers Data base to answer my three questions which were as follows:
    Are movies more profitable with a budget:
    over $200 million?
    between $100 and $200 million?
    between $50 and $100 million?

## Conclusions
Budget > $200 million ~ Net Profit Increase of 234%
Budget between $100 million and $200 Million ~  Net Profit increase of 204%
Budget between $50 million and $100 Million ~  Net Profit increase of 154%
More likely for a movie with a budget between $50 and $100 million to not make it to theaters at all

## Recommendation
Create Movies with only a budget over $200 Million


## Next Steps
Sort movies with a budget of over $200 million by director, genre, and runtime
Analyze by studio to see which employees we need to poach
