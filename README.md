## General info
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of pandas in analyzing large data sets. 
	
## Methods
After using pandas to rearch through each individual file, I decided on using the Numbers Data base to answer my three questions which were as follows:
    Are movies more profitable with a budget:
    over $200 million?
    between $100 and $200 million?
    between $50 and $100 million?
